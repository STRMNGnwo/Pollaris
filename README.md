Repository for the Pollaris web app

Pollaris is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that aims to use an unconventional medium to create connections between people. It was built on the idea that people who have similar opinions tend to get along with each other, and have a good chance of creating a meaningful friendship. Pollaris uses Polls (yes, polls like the ones you see on Buzzfeed and Reddit), as its primary medium to make new friends!. Users can create their own Polls and make then Private or Public. Private polls are viewable only by the users's friends and Public polls are viewable by people in a 2km radius around the poll creator(if the user provided their location, if they don't the poll is global and can be seen by a lot of people :) ).Pollaris also features a robust Friend and Chat system.
